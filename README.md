# CoreDataDemo
Demo showing how to use CoreData, establish relationships, modeling, CoreData CRUD operations

To use CoreData

1. Define your entities and attributes in the Core Data Model
2. Generate your classes from the core model
3. Get a reference to the core data persistent container (typically a singleton)
4. From the persistent container, you get a managed object context. Using the Managed Object Context, you can create objects
and store them in core data for retrieval for later use
